Review of snippet1.py

The function, variable, and class names are not at all understandable. What are they and what do they do?!
Needs more comments
Completely unintelligiblle...well almost completely
Too much nesting


Review of snippet2.py

Comments ask questions rather than explaining something about the code
Some comments explain that which is understandable by reading the code
Comment at bottom is useless...


Review of snippet3.py

Hardcoded path won't exist on other computers
There is no path variable declaton in any method other than init, but is referred to in several methods
Other variables are never declared or created before being referenced
Directions comment not needed
Name == Main conditional at the bottom doesn't make sense. There is no main function


Review of snippet4.py

Still no declaration of self.path that is acccessable by all methods
