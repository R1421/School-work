Treasure Hunting Game
	Define game elements(Grid/Treasures)
	Build Gameboard and treasures
	Initialize game
		Listen for user guess
			If guess is a treasure
				Add treasure value to score
				Delete treasure
			Else
				Deactivate space
				Decrease all treasure values by 10%
			If all treasure is found
				End game
	
	GameBoard class
		Private
			string display = "Score"
			int score = 0
			int scoreLocation
		Public
			GameBoard(int dimension)
				Use DMA to create a gameboard array
			void setScore(int addScore)
				score += addScore
			int getScore()
				return score
			string getDisplay()
				return display

	Treasure class
		Private
			int points
		Public
			Treasure(int boundary)
			While true
				Produce random value pair in boundary
				if values not already declared for another treasure
					save treasure location with these values
			~Treasure()


**The Treasure constructor's while loop could maybe be done with a function 
that creates all the values then creates all the treasures with those values
