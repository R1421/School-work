If the location list is empty:
		Add the start location to the ordered location list
		Add the distance to the start to the successive distance list
		Set current location to start
		Exit the while loop
For the remaining locations in the list

		Add A to the ordered location list
		Add the distance to A to the distance list
		Pop A out of the location list
		Set Current location to A



Print the ordered location list and the succesive distance list
