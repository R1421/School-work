Raymond Duncan
CSCI 3022

The general approach that I took to complete this homework was to first complete the parts that I already knew how to solve and then spend the bulk of my time on the later questions. I originally tried tocomplete the tasks using generators, but that proved too difficult (I'll need to look into improving my skills in that later).

The only external resources I used for this project were documentation pages for the included libraries. 

I found the distinction between the two different instances of New Jersey District 1 to add to the confusion/difficulty of the assignment since only one of the two instances were correct.
